# K-means and PCA Implementations
The notebook includes an implementation of K-means, K-means++, and PCA. K-means is a clustering algorithm that partitions data into k distinct groups based on feature similarity, while PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, capturing the most variance in the data. General description of the implementation can be found [here](https://kirubelsol.github.io/pages/kmeans.html). The code includes 

- **K-means Implementation**
- **K-means ++ Implementation and comparison with K-menas**
- **Image Compression Using Both Methods**
- **Principal component analysis Implementation**
